# Social Network


## Description
This application is a mock-up of a social networking API that uses postman to create user data along with thoughts and reactions and properly links those thoughts and reactions to the correct user. You can even use it to mock-up a friends list that properly displays the associated friend with the user. This application is not inteded for actual use and is merely a demonstration of my knowledge thus far using mongoose.

## Usage
This application is a test of my knowledge and abilities to create a social networking API and create all the routes to properly get it going. This is also for grading purposes.
